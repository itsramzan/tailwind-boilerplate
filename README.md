# Tailwind CSS Boilerplate

## Overview

The **Tailwind CSS Boilerplate** is a project template designed to help you kickstart your web development projects using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It includes a basic project structure and development scripts to simplify your workflow.

### Features

- Set up for using Tailwind CSS.
- Development scripts for watching changes and serving your project.
- Easily customizable to fit your project's needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsramzan/tailwind-boilerplate.git
cd tailwind-boilerplate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

If you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

If you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

This will run two development scripts concurrently:

`dev:tailwind`: Compiles your Tailwind CSS by watching changes in "src/input.css" and outputting to "src/style.css"

`dev:server`: Starts a development server with live-reloading on port 9000 for your project in the "src" directory.

### 4. Preview Your Project

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9000 to see your project in action.

### Customization

Feel free to customize this boilerplate to fit your project's specific requirements. You can modify the Tailwind CSS configuration, add more HTML files, or make changes to the development scripts in the "package.json" file.
